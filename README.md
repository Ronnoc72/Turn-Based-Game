# Turn-Based-Game
This is a turn based game that you can pick your class and attack enemies for an infinite amount of time or until your character dies. You can get potions and access them in your inventory (view the TBG_HELP). This is the first project that I am really proud of and I know it's not perfect, but it is the first major project that uses OOP.
